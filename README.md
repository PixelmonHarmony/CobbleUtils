# Cobbleutils

## Description

Cobbleutils is a collection of utilities and features for cobblemon. It is a work in progress and will be updated as new
features are added.

## Features

**Party System** - Organize and play with friends easily. Part of an expandable system with other plugins created by us.

**Reward System** - Stores items that would normally be lost if the user's inventory is full, ensuring they don't lose
those rewards. This is useful for users who are busy running or doing other activities and might not notice they've
received a reward. Users can only retrieve rewards from this system; they cannot store items in it.

**Custom Commands** - Set up commands to give Pokémon, items, and money based on specific categories.

**Pokémon Spawning with Sizes** - Spawn Pokémon in different sizes for a unique touch!

**Pokerus** - Infect your Pokémon with Pokerus!

**ShinyToken** - Convert your Pokémon to shiny!

**Egg Hatching** - Hatch eggs faster! (Coming soon)

**Safe Trade** - Trade Pokemons, Items, and Money with other players safely! (Coming soon)
